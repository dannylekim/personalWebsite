# Personal Website 

My goal is to create a personal website that displays my achievements and current capabilities. In this manner, I will have 2 websites. 

1) This will be my personal website which doubles as a resume. It will outline who I am, and what my projects have been and display them all. 

2) My blog which will be hosted elsewhere and maintained by me but not coded by me as that requires a lot of work for minimal gain.

## Sections 

Below describe the sections placed on the site and or other websites

### About me 

     These include Jobs, a blurb, technologies I know and other tidbits

### Blog Website

Inside these blog posts should be notes from books and articles that I've read and general stylistic things. These include:
