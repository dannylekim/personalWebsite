# Personal Website 

In this personal website, I'd like to use it as a form of resume or CV that gives employers and other connections a chance to get to know me and my skill set. This code will also be open source for those who would like to use it under Apache 2.0 or MIT depending on the projects integrated onto this website. The website itself in terms of its technologies and everything will be in MIT. 

## Sections
